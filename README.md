## General information
 WhatsTheHaps? is a web service that combines the calendars of all Aalto guilds and shows a clear weekly calendar overview of all the different Guild events, showing the time of the event location as well as by which guild the event is organized.
 With our service we aim to provide a clear overview of all guild events to provide a better experience to both guild organizers and students when organizing and signing up for events, thus offering students a better-quality student life at Aalto University.

This is the backend part of the project written in Node.js.
